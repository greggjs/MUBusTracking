MUBusTracking
=============

This is the public repository for the Miami University Bus Tracking app for iOS. 

This app is meant to help out the students of Miami University with tracking the locations of all buses at Miami University. It provides an easy interface to allow students to visually see the locations of the buses on their phone and look at where the bus is on the route. They are also able to enable push notifactions so that they are alerted when a bus comes within 1 stop of their desired stop. Also, they are able to use the push service for alerts on the status of buses, such as if they are running late, broken down, or stop service early.
